##Explanation
This paper may be different from English papers you are written in the past, because it does not require an explicit argument. Instead, it asks you to choose a single text (or of you prefer a group of texts), find a feature (a theme, question, or specific formal characteristic) running through it, and write a series of close readings focusing on some textual locations where that feature exists. 

The assignment therefore sits between the kinds of individual close readings we have been working on and a full-force literature paper. It asks you to explore the text and assemble a set of close readings that have enough in common that they might be able to become the basis for a paper with an argument. Yet you need not make that argument. The common thread that you are exploring should be, however, sufficiently clear to your reader. 

Here are some examples; my general advice is to try to keep the kinds of themes and categories you think about pursuing very specific; staying away from the large themes, motifs, etc that jump out at you from a text will give you a more unexpected and probably more interesting reading. Below, I give examples of both some more specific paths and some larger themes that would need to be shaved down, remodeled, and reshaped in the course of your writing. 

##Examples [^1]
+ Moments that imagine the current state of a far-away addressor of a letter or other communication
+ Moments of blankness and illegibility (in JE or In Mem)
+ Moments of quotation (this probably needs to be more narrowly defined)
+ References to form in In Mem (this also would likely get more narrow as you began to work)
+ Authority and rebellion in JE (and again, needs to be more narrow)
+ Tree images in In Mem
